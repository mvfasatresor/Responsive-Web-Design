        <h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp's curriculum.</h1>
        <h2>Please slow down and read this.</h2>
        <p>freeCodeCamp is a proven path to your first software developer job.</p>
        <p>More than 40,000 people have gotten developer jobs after completing this – including at big companies like Google and Microsoft.</p>
        <p>If you are new to programming, we recommend you start at the beginning and earn these certifications in order.</p>
        <p>To earn each certification, build its 5 required projects and get all their tests to pass.</p>
        <p>You can add these certifications to your résumé or LinkedIn. But more important than the certifications is the practice you get along the way.</p>
        <p>If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard.</p>
        <p>Practice is the key. Practice, practice, practice.</p>
        <p>And this curriculum will give you thousands of hours of hands-on programming practice.</p>
        <p>And if you want to learn more math and computer science theory, we also have thousands of hours of video courses on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp"> freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.</a></p>
        <p>If you want to get a developer job or freelance clients, programming skills will be just part of the puzzle. You also need to build your personal network and your reputation as a developer.</p>
        <p>You can do this on LinkedIn and GitHub, and also on <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/">the freeCodeCamp forum.</a></p>
        <p>Happy coding!</p>
